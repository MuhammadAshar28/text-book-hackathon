## Prompt

Can you make the history of what frontend you make to my prompt

## Response snapshot

I'll help you create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for your request about the frontend history. This PHR documents your request asking for history of frontend work previously done based on your prompts.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting request for frontend history tracking
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: history/prompts/general/0001-request-frontend-history.general.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Follow up on specific frontend work done previously
- 🧠 Reflection: Users may want to track history of AI-assisted frontend development work
