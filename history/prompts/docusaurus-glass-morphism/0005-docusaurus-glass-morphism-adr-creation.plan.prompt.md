## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the Docusaurus glass-morphism UI enhancement. The ADR documents the architectural decision to implement a comprehensive glass-morphism UI system using pure CSS effects, custom React components, and adaptive theming, with details on the rationale, consequences, alternatives considered, and references to related documentation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created permanent record of architectural decision for glass-morphism UI
- 🧪 Tests: ADR follows template structure with all required sections
- 📁 Files: New ADR file created in history/adr directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task breakdown phase
- 🧠 Reflection: ADR documents important architectural decision with tradeoffs and rationale

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - ADR follows all required structure and content guidelines
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with task breakdown based on this architectural decision
