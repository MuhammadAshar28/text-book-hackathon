$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Docusaurus glass-morphism UI enhancement. Tasks are organized by user story priority with proper checklist format (checkbox, ID, story labels) and clear file paths. Includes 8 phases: Setup, Foundational, 5 user story phases (US1-US5), and polish phase. Total of 64 specific tasks identified, with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities mapped out. MVP scope defined as Phase 1 (Setup), Phase 2 (Foundational), and Phase 3 (US1 - Modern Glass-Morphism Homepage).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks follow required checklist format with IDs and story labels
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created with organized task breakdown
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for development execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown enables independent implementation of each user story
